      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>At Zappos.com, our purpose is simple: to live and deliver WOW.</p>
      <p> Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
          shoes. Today, we still sell shoes — as well as <br /> clothing, handbags,
          accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer
          service, customer <br /> experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire
          the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver <br /> happiness
          to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a
          long-term, sustainable way.</p>
      <p>We hope thta in the future people won't even realize we started br
        selling shoes online . instead they will know zappes as a <br /> service company that just happens to sell --------</p>
